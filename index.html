		<h2>Major Attraction Concepts</h2>
			
		<div class="conceptHeader">Mystery Manor</div>
			<img class="concept"src="img/mysteryManor.png">
				<p>  Do you think that you are the next Sherlock Holmes?  Or have you ever wanted to star in your own crime adventure mystery?  Then Mystery Manor is the attraction for you!  In the early 1900's a widow lived in this manor but was murdered!  She is said to still haunt the premises, but she it not alone!  The spirits of her husband, house keeper, stable boy and various other spirits are said to linger at the manor.  Using your toolkit (Mobile App) you will solve the mystery!  Take finger prints, scan for blood, discover hidden secrets and talk to the dead.  Beware the Mystery Manor secrets run deep!</p>
				<br>-Visitors will use web enabled smart devices with camera capabilities to view clues and explore new areas of the Mystery Manor. They will have the option to use their own or rented device.  On personal devices users will have to download Virtual Tera's augmented reality application.  On rented devices the augmented reality app will come preinstalled.  The app turns the user's device into a virtual crime kit and paranormal tracking device.  Visitors will explore Mystery Manor and by hovering their device over suspicious items unlock new content and clues.   When the users unlock and solve a certain amount of clues new rooms will be open to them.  Rooms know which visitors to permit because the app will send out a signal either via wifi signal or RF tag reader that tells the doors to open.
				<br></br>   
				Requirements: Device with internet capabilities, wi-fi connection, and camera.  Must run on standard operating system that meets modern technology specs.

	<div class="conceptHeader">Virtual Walk Through</div>
		<img class="concept"src="img/cave_maze.png">
			<p> Become lost in the mind bending world of the maze. Each part of the maze deals with alien landscapes such as the Moon, Mars, Saturn and Neptune.  Experience environments quite unlike our own.</p>
			<br>-This attraction is a cross between an art installation, planetarium and a maze.  It requires visitors to wear 3D glasses to view the 3D world.  3D projectors will be used to create the projections on the walls and visitors will follow along a path as they experience other worldly environments.
			<br></br>
			Requirements: Short Throw Projector

	<div class="conceptHeader">Interaction Room</div>
		<img class="concept"src="img/interactRoom_Dance.png">
			<p>Tired of jogging on a treadmill?  Bored of staring at a wall while doing the elliptical?  Then try the interact room!  The Interact Room allows you to do cardio exercise through dancing, kickboxing, and various games.  Unlike a standard gaming console in your living room, this room is an immersive experience that is tailored to tracking your body movements.  It provides an array of fun environments (Beach, Night Club, Pool, city, etc.) to choose from.  It also provides games that allow you to kick, smash and hit targets.  
			<br></br>Requirements: Short Throw Projector <a href="http://goo.gl/Lk9dQ6">Short Throw Projectors</a> Cave Technology <a href="http://www.worldviz.com/systems/cornercave">World Viz</a>.<br>Example: Interactive Forest Example <a href="http://goo.gl/YierLr"/>YouTube</a>. </p>
		 
		 <img class="concept"src="img/interactRoom_meditate.png">
			<p>Learn Yoga or Pilates from a virtual instructor or pick from a plethora of relaxing environments to meditate in.</p>
			<br>-This room will use "short throw projectors" to display content on the walls.  Multiple tracking devices such as the Kinect will be used to follow users' movements. A computer will keep track of the content being shown on the screen.
			<h2>Simulation Bike</h2>
		<img class="concept"src="img/simulation_bike.png">
			<p>Do you feel like you are "spinning" on a road to nowhere?  Well try, the simulation bike!  This bike puts the rider in the front seat to an awesome ride!  Riders can star in their own adventure movie where they out ride the bad guys, aliens, zombies and monsters, oh my!  Or riders can chose from a relaxed scenic bike ride through some of the most tranquil parks and neighborhoods in the world.</p>
			<br>-Sensors detect when the user's pedal speed increases via an accelerometer.  This sends a signal to the computer to increase the speed in the simulation.  In addition, the bike can react to the simulation by tilting the platform based on curves in the simulations and inclines on the hills. <br></br>Required Technology:
			a Motion Platform <a href="http://goo.gl/zJRHKV">CKAS</a>, Accelerometer <a href="http://goo.gl/9Fzmtz">CTC Online</a>.<br>  
			Example Bike Simulator<br>
